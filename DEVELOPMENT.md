# Development Guide

**Note:** The latest version of portable-atomic is 1.x. portable-atomic 0.3 (this branch) is now (since 0.3.20) built on top of portable-atomic 1.x to make bug fixes and improvements such as [support for new targets](https://github.com/taiki-e/portable-atomic/pull/86) in 1.x available to the ecosystem that depends on older portable-atomic.

The development guide for this branch is obsolete. See [the development guide for the main branch](https://github.com/taiki-e/portable-atomic/blob/HEAD/DEVELOPMENT.md).
