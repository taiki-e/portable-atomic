// On AArch64, the base register of load/store/atomic instructions must be 64-bit.
// Passing a 32-bit value to \`in(reg)\` on AArch64 results in the upper bits
// having an undefined value, but to work correctly with ILP32 ABI, the upper
// bits must be zero, which is handled here by casting to u64. Another way to
// handle this is to pass it as a pointer and clear the upper bits inside asm,
// but it is easier to overlook than cast, which can catch overlooks by
// asm_sub_register lint.
// See also https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/2023Q1/aapcs64/aapcs64.rst#57pointers
//
// Except for x86_64, which can use 32-bit registers in the destination operand
// (on x86_64, we use the ptr_modifier macro to handle this), we need to do the
// same for ILP32 ABI on other 64-bit architectures. (At least, as far as I can
// see from the assembly generated by LLVM, this is also required for MIPS64 N32
// ABI. I don't know about the RISC-V s64ilp32 ABI for which a patch was
// recently submitted to the kernel, but in any case, this should be a safe
// default for such ABIs).
//
// Known architectures that have such ABI are x86_64 (X32), aarch64 (ILP32),
// mips64 (N32), and riscv64 (s64ilp32, not merged yet though). (As of
// 2023-06-05, only the former two are supported by rustc.) However, we list all
// known 64-bit architectures because similar ABIs may exist or future added for
// other architectures.
