# (enabled by default) Enable fallback implementations.
#
# Disabling this allows only atomic types for which the platform natively supports atomic operations.
fallback = []

# Enable run-time CPU feature detection.
#
# This allows maintaining support for older CPUs while using features that are not supported on older CPUs, such as cmpxchg16b (x86_64) and LSE (aarch64).
#
# Note:
# - Dynamic detection is currently only enabled in Rust 1.61+ for aarch64 and in nightly for other platforms, otherwise it works the same as the default.
# - If the required target features are enabled at compile-time, the atomic operations are inlined.
# - This is compatible with no-std (as with all features except `std`).
outline-atomics = []

# Provide `AtomicF{32,64}`.
# Note that most of `fetch_*` operations of atomic floats are implemented using CAS loops, which can be slower than equivalent operations of atomic integers.
float = []

# Provides generic `Atomic<T>` type.
#
# Note:
# - This implicitly enables the `fallback` feature.
generic = ["fallback"]

# Provide derive(Atomicable).
derive = ["portable-atomic-derive"]

# Use `alloc`.
alloc = []

# Use `std`.
#
# Note:
# - This implicitly enables the `alloc` feature.
std = ["alloc"]
